        <p>My name is Dr. Richard Smith, a postdoctoral researcher at NOIRLab's Gemini North Observatory in Hilo, Hawaii. 
        My current research focuses on variable stars in the Andromeda Galaxy using Hubble Space Telescope data. I am using a combination of light
			curve and difference imaging analysis to identify and characterise different types of variable stars. In the most recent publication from
			this study, my collaborators and I identified, confirmed and classified variable stars in stellar clusters within M31. We were able to classify
			these cluster variable stars as a result of previously obtained age and metallicity estimates for their host clusters, allowing for cluster isochrones
			to be produced. We therefore utilized the observed variability of M31 cluster stars and, for the first time, their isochrone-derived stellar properties 
			to identify their variable star classes.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I moved to Hilo in August 2023 after graduating from my doctoral program at Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland, in July 2023.
		    My thesis investigated the properties of trans-Neptunian Binaries using archival Hubble Space Telescope observations. At the heart of this
			study was the development and application of a sophisticated point spread function-fitting algorithm capable of accurately measuring the
			position and brightness values of both binary components simultaneously. </p>

<!-- 		    I am originally from northwest England, where my passion for physics and astronomy was first kindled by making a map of the lunar surface,
		    including the Apollo landing sites. I was selected for the Ogden Trust Schools Physicist of the Year Award at secondary school, which led to a series
		    of successful Ogden Trust Summer Internships at universities around the UK during my undergraduate studies 
		    at the University of Liverpool. -->
